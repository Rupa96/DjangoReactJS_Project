`Agenda`- Build a CRUD application for storing empployee data with ReacJS and Django.
        - CRUD stands for Create,Read,Update and Delete, so baiscally this app would 
          allow you to  take a look at each employee data and being able to create,update 
          and delete "employee" records.
